We are doing pattern question, okay, let's close this, let's close this, yes, we have to pattern questions, what are the pattern questions, wait, I am cleaning this up.
Okay, yes, pattern questions are like, in many times we may might be asked, we have to design the pattern like this, let's start from simple, yes, this one.
This is a pattern. So, anyone can ask like, we have to print this pattern. So, all the pattern questions are sold with this trick, but the trick trick is, we have to imagine this as in matrix, we treated this as 0, rows this side.
These are the rows. Let me expand this. Okay. This is the row. Okay. And this is the column. Hmm. Okay, nice.
Okay, so, press this. Column, this side. What are the column? This is column, this second column, third column, fourth column, fifth column.
So, hmmm. Let me do this more simple. Okay. Now, I have to print this one, print this one. Oh, I selected this one.
Okay. So, this one, this, this, this, and this. Okay. And here, like, wait. Okay. Done. This is the, what is this is the first row.
First column. And this is the first row. Simple. Here, this is first row. And this is first row. This is 2 by 2 matrix.
So if we treat this, if we get the formula, like in which column and in which row we have to print the print star or nothing.
So here we have to print. Start from first row, first column, start second row second column, first row second column.
We have to print star, third row, row 1, column third. This one two, okay. This one three. This one four.
This one five. This one six, okay. In first row second column, start. In first row third column, it's star. So we are.
So, we are painting this up to, this is second row. This is the third row. This is the fourth row.
Fifth row, sixth row, okay. Make it clear, okay. So, we have to print like this. So, we get the formula.
What formula? We have to print. From first row to sixth row. And first column to sixth column. All, we have to print stars.
Nothing else. So, let's write. We have to print from first row. So, int row, h to zero. Up to when, up to less than seven, okay.
And we have to increase, okay, simple. Now, we have to iterate in column also. So, it's two by two. Two by two are D array, it's two D array.
So, we again iterate through column. Column less than, column must be less than seven. It's going from zero to one to six.
So, it must go from zero to. And column must increase. Now, what we have to, we have to print in first row r equals to zero means first row.
We have to. Print all through. So, in the same line. So, we are using C's print not print a line.
We have to print in the same line. So, we have to just print in the. Same. Same line. So, if work is done.
So, we print in braces after completing the first row. We are again printing in new line. So, here what we do?
06:24 This is. We have to just print one new line done. Enter. Close this. Done. Let's do this. Let's comment it out and save.
06:42 Enter. Oh. You got that simple. So, this is done. Less to. For second question. For the second problem. Second problem is this.
07:06 Okay. Okay. Let's take this. Okay. This is also simple. We first have to increase. This is 2 i to d, to, to d array and here, hm, this is row, this is column.
07:28 So, in first row we have to print only one column. In second row we have to print. In third row we have to print three column.
07:37 In fourth row we have to print four column. In fifth row we have to print fifth, fifth, five column. So, column is increasing with row.
07:48 So, row must be, column must be less than row. In fourth row less than equals to, go to it. We have to print star up to n, up to five.
08:04 So, if we have to put the condition, if. Or what we, we get the formula of the column. Formula like hold, it's first increasing, then decreasing.
08:22 So, it will increase up to five. So, if row equals to five. If. Two equals to what? Five. Means it's maximum value.
08:46 No, maximum by two. If it, if it reaches maximum by two. Here how many rows? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
09:01 So it's going up to nine. So when it reaches, it's half. So if, row equals two. Let's take this and, think this is nine.
09:25 Okay. We have to print up two and, if row, equals two and by two. Then what we have to do?
09:37 We have to decrease. We have to make the column decrease, decrease by what? N minus row. This is what? Total n minus, This much rows.
09:51 Okay. So we have to make, column. Let's take it temporary. How many times do you have to print this? So, no.
10:11 How many times do you have to iterate? So this must be, outer from this loop. This is the formula for column.
10:22 Okay. So in, column, equals, to, how many times it'll, it must be here, here must be t, less t. How many times it'll iterate?
10:44 So let's take this t and this t, okay. If rho is greater than or equals to n by 2, then, e must be equals to n minus rho.
11:18 Got it. And we have to iterate column up to t. So we got it. So let us comment it out.
11:29 And print this. Oh, we got our pattern. It's easy. So one thing is missing. Finally two printed. And one is missing.
11:44 So we have to make it equal. This must be, add final iteration true equals to let me make this equal.
12:00 Okay, print it. Then, this problem also done. So, what's the third problem? Third problem is little bit complex. Note that much complex is, is a there?
12:37 Oh, here's the, here's the easy one. Easy one of this, we have to print up two half. So, it's easy.
12:46 You can do this. So, what's the next problem? Next problem is, okay. This one. This one, you have to think a little bit.
13:04 We have to find the, pattern. Pattern like what? Here we find a formula. Means the column for the column. How many times pattern.
13:25 Number. Number. So we have to find here. What we have to find. In first row, first column, what we have to print.
13:38 So let's say this an integer and so let's come and get out. This is the maximum integer. This is even 4, okay.
13:51 So row will iterate up to 3, 3, 3, 6, 7. So 2 n minus 1. Row will. So iterate up to 2.
14:08 Done. So here we have to find how many times, not how many times. Column also print up to 7 times.
14:28 3, 4, 3, 7, yeah. Column also print up to 2 and times. Just we have to find which number must be presented.
14:43 Select that position, okay. So, hmmm, now work for this. Now use. So, we have, we don't have to print us, okay.
14:56 We have to print a number. So, let's say this int number, both 2. Or we have to find this. How can you find this?
15:08 Think. Here, if row in 0 column is row 1, column 1, 4. For first row, it's this. If. Row is increasing.
15:25 So. Let's say 2. So column change start changing from 2. Decreasing from start to. Okay. If row is 3. It start from 3.
15:40 Okay. And. I, I have to check recording. Recording. Okay. So, okay. You have to find a relation. How can we find this number?
16:01 Look. It's making a series. Outer side. It's all four. Inner side, it's all three. And again, inner side is all two.
16:17 Again, inner side is one. So, let's try this. Here, there is one tree. So, let's start with zero. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
16:36 And again, one. One, one, one, one. Not one. It's first year to zero. Then one. One. And again, zero. Next.
16:54 Zero. Again, two. Okay. Now, we have to print one here. So, one here and again zero. One thing you will notice.
17:16 Zero. One. Two. Now, we have to print three. Three. And again, two. We have two print here, okay. Two. One.
17:38 And zero. In next row. Zero. Zero. One. Two. Two. Three. Two. Two. One. Zero. Now, you are saying, eh, again we have to print which row.
17:56 This one. Two. Triple two. Okay. Okay. Okay. This one. Two. Okay. Wait. This one. Two. This one. Two. This one.
18:19 Two. Okay. Again with three. Okay. Now, which row? Okay. This row. Okay. Okay. If you print this and in the next row, I need to print this.
18:43 Go to it. Just copy. Okay. Now, one commune notice. This one is one step closer from all the sides. Okay.
19:09 This, this is the outer. So, this is the zero steps. We can move to zero from any side. So, two, two is two steps away from this and this.
19:26 The mini. One step, two reach to two is two. The minimum steps, two reach to three. It's three, zero, one, two, three.
19:41 You can check from any side. The minimum step to reach to that point is, printing that only. And only thing we have to, why the printing?
19:52 We have to decrease. We have to do n minus this one. Okay? Like n is four, so n minus zero is zero.
20:03 All the things. So now you go to it. Like, So let's start writing. Let's make an array of 2 by 2.
20:17 And what how to write code for this? How can we write code? So we have a row. Okay, we have a column.
20:28 Okay. So let's print this first. Okay, done. So we have to find this. How can you find this? This will zero through and zero through column.
20:58 So we're in the number we have to print. Let's say x. We have to find this. So this must be what this number?
21:11 This number is third row and second column. This number is how many steps? First row, second row, third row, third row, third column is true.
21:32 How can you get this? This is, this is first row and third column. So to move this, we have to either, we have to cover the column.
21:48 Okay? Either we have to cover the column or we have to cover the rows. Like, how can we go to this?
21:58 From row, we can go directly from this side, we can go from this side, we can go from, this side we can go from bottom side we can go.
22:07 So, how to reach to this point? So, let us say, first we are reaching from, in, we are reaching from upside.
22:17 Upside must be equals to, upside like, we have to reach. Let us, through rows, how many rows we are called like, let us suppose we have to reach to this, this, from upside, from upside like, first row, second row, third row, fourth row, fifth row, sixth row, if the row is starting from zero, so we have
22:42 to, do like this, zero, third row, first row, second row, third row, fourth row, fifth row, so how many steps, fifth, so this must be equals to row, so, non it, and from left side, up, first row, first row, first row, simply if you can write this, like equals to row, and, and, left, this must be, from
23:14 this must be column, correct, because in column is this subside, from, we have to move, from left, left, so in 0th column, first column, so this, equals to column, we got it.
23:29 So, if we have to reach from bottom side, bottom side, this must be equals to, from bottom, let us, we have to reach to this point.
23:40 So, so, so, so, so. So, how many lines are there? From bottom side, we have to, a minus, a total number of rows, minus, we, how many we have called, okay, total number of rows, how many rows, 7, 7 is what?
24:00 2 n minus 1, okay, and we have to decrease how many rows we have called, so it must be, minus, so, about it, this is what?
24:19 This is, this is, bottom side, okay, in, right side, but not left, right side, this must be same as like this, true, right, minus 1, minus column, put it, and we have to find all the minimum, we have to find the shortest path.
24:51 So, in the x, that should be printed, this must be equals to minimum of, so we are doing math. Dot minimum, minimum of all these four.
25:08 So, first we find the minimum of this, so right, and then minimum of math dot minimum, we have a good minimum, we have a good maximum, bad good minimum of, we are seeing here left, and we are comparing with.
25:37 Math, good minimum of what, depend on, append, but append, and butter, x, so. We have to find first a, a, a minimum of append, but upside and bottom side, then we compare with the left side, then we compare with the right side, and just we have to print the number.
26:10 So, this is out, not print a length, we have to, hmmm, print in the same line. So, what we have to print?
26:19 We have to print not zero. So, we have to, a decrease from 4. So, what is 4? N minus x, ok.
26:31 Plus, let us print a space for linear visibility. I think we have to cover the idea. So, let us try to print if there is some error.
26:50 We try to Here we are printing 5 extra 5. Let us give us the error. I think what is the row?
27:06 We must be what? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. So, row must be both 1 2 and not 2 and 2 and is 8.
27:21 So, this must be less than and row it is starting from 0. So, it must be minus 1. Well, we will be the same.
27:34 That's one. Yeah, cool. And, and what? We have to print up minus row. Yeah, I think all the things are same.
27:46 Yeah. Let's try to run. Okay. We are getting. So many empty spaces. Okay. Okay. There are some hidden. Okay. Oh, we got this.
28:07 No. One more thing is to be printed. One thing is four have to be. There must be one more line for four.
28:17 Okay. Three, four, seven. How many four are? Okay. Here, four is not 20. Here, one percent. And here must be, one must be four.
28:31 So I think we have to. So, see if it is the column, the integral of what it is. Wait. Oh.
28:55 We have to print space. Okay. So, I am trying to run again. When I read it, it is there. What's the error?
29:06 We are, I am getting. So, code the delix subset. I think some exception are there. Some error is there or not.
29:29 Wait. First try to resolve this three. Three printed, second two printed, two printed, one printed and this, why is this three?
29:44 From bottom side, bottom side and right side are wrong. So, bottom side this must be, to n minus 1. What's the, hmmm, if we take this zero?
29:57 So, this is, so test from bottom side. To n minus 1. 7, minus 1. 7, which row? 7, through. 2, 2, 7, minus 1.
30:09 This printed, minus 1. This printed the minus 1. Okay, we have to remove minus 1. Simple. And same in color.
30:26 Yeah, I think this same, this is the value of the value. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Some mix up some eye there.
30:43 What are you doing? Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. What brought our minds to? 4, 3, 4, 3, 2. Why I'm so many there.
30:57 I think there are some air in this terminal. Let's close this. Okay, all this clear. This is clear. And we are printing space.
31:11 That's good. Yeah, that's good. And we are in the new line we are printing. Left we are checking. Oh, bottom.
31:23 Right side, left side, okay. Bottom side, yeah. We are comparing with let's say rho is seven and rho is seven, two and two and eight, eight one is eight, eight minus eight.
31:48 Rho, s u it's rho seven rho. So we have to make this like a rho plus one. There it was correct, I think.
32:08 So rho is seven. So, so test distance to this must be zero. So rho we are calculating from zero. So this equals to, what this equals to minus rho minus one.
32:29 This must be equal to this and why you are not printing. Let us try this bottom side. The bottom side must be correct.
32:38 It is correct. No, it is not correct. Left side is also disturbed. Yeah. So let us. Let me make this minus one also.
32:51 Right one again. Okay. Okay. And here, hmmm, 4, 4, 3, 7. Okay. This must be equal to okay. Only error is.
33:06 From bottom side, we are getting added from bottom side, error of what minus one? What if you have to print up to 1, and I think this is the error.
33:35 Okay, we got it. We got it. Is the error. So, we have to print up to 1, 1 minus 1, okay.
33:48 So, we got our answer. Okay, that is the only thing. What do you We have to find the formula at which index this is first row first column.
34:11 So, at this index, how can we get this? So, we have to create formula. We have to find some similarity, some repeatability.
34:21 How numbers are repeating. So, we have to find that. So, that is dependent on logic. So, we have to get the logic and solve that formula.
34:32 Just find now which index is printed. So, print that index and problem solved. So, all the pattern should be solved by this only.
34:44 So, bye bye.
